# Scalan Community Edition

## Intro

Scalan is a framework for creating staged embedded DSLs in Scala. It allows you to write high-level Scala programs and compile them to efficient low-level code (in the language determined by the used backend) and to develop new abstractions which can be used in such programs.

[Scalan Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalan) is used for Scalan-related discussions. See also [Contributions](#contributions) below.

### Building the project and running tests

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) is required to build Scalan. See linked documentation for installing and using SBT itself. There is also [an improved runner](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras) which takes care of downloading correct SBT version and adds some extra features.

The project consists of several [subprojects](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Multi-Project.html), including the aggregate project `scalan`.

One of the subprojects, `lms-backend` currently depends on a fork of [LMS](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/virtualization-lms-core/) located at <http://github.com/scalan/virtualization-lms-core>, branch `scalan-develop`. If you want to use it, you need to clone and build this dependency first, since it isn't published in a public repository. It also requires a different version of Scala from the one used by the other projects, which is why it isn't a part of the aggregate project. SBT commands such as `test`, `compile`, etc. will not run on it by default; you need to use `lms-backend/whatever-command` or `project lms-backend` and then the commands you want.

The tests are split into unit tests (which can be run with the usual `test` SBT command) and integration tests (`it:test`) which actually generate a program (using some backend) and test the generated code. As of this writing, the only backend included is `lms-backend` and so you need to use `lms-backend/it:test` to run integration tests.

If you want to create your own project depending on Scalan, you have two options:

* use `publishLocal` (and `lms-backend/publishLocal`, if necessary) SBT command to deploy Scalan to your local Ivy repository;

* use a [project reference](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.12.4/docs/Dormant/Full-Configuration.html#project-references) to Scalan in your build instead of `libraryDependencies`.

## Writing programs

Scalan is embedded into Scala, so all standard rules of Scala syntax apply and knowledge of Scala is assumed in this manual. However, it only supports a limited subset of types and operations. Note that if you write a program which is legal Scala, but not legal Scalan, there are currently no error messages or warnings. This is planned to be changed in the future.

### Types

All Scalan values have type `Rep[A]` for some Scala type `A`. Currently `A` can be one of the following types:

1. Base types: `Boolean`, `Byte`, `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`. `String` will be added soon.
2. Pairs `(A, B)`. Larger tuples are are represented as pairs nested to the right, so e.g. instead of `Rep[(Int, Int, Boolean)]` you write `Rep[(Int, (Int, Boolean))]`.
3. Sums `Either[A, B]` (can also be written as `A | B`).
4. Functions `A => B`. Functions with multiple arguments are emulated by functions taking a tuple (or by currying), such as `Rep[((A, B)) => C]` (note double parentheses).
5. Arrays `Array[A]` (in `community-edition` subproject).
6. Traits and classes added by DSL developers (see "Extending Scalan" section below).

Note that nested `Rep` is not allowed. There are type aliases for some `Rep` types, such as `type IntRep = Rep[Int]`, `type Arr[A] = Rep[Array[A]]`, etc.

Scala values of type `A` can be converted to `Rep[A]` implicitly (or explicitly using `toRep` method if desired). However, it's impossible to convert from `Rep[A]` to `A`.

### Operations

Scalan supports the usual arithmetic, logical, ordering, etc. operations. They are added by implicit conversions on `Rep`, so e.g. `y + x` where `x: Rep[Int]` and `y: Int` doesn't compile; write `toRep(y) + x` or `x + y` instead. There are currently no implicit widening conversions from `Rep[Int]` to `Rep[Long]`, from `Rep[Float]` to `Rep[Double]`, etc. Methods like `toInt` and `toDouble` should be used instead.
~~~scala
val x: Rep[Int] = 1

x + 3
~~~
As in Scala, arithmetical operations on `Rep[T]` require an implicit `Numeric[T]` (`Fractional[T]` for `/`) to be in scope, and ordering operations require an `Ordering[T]`.

Equality is written `===` and inequality `!==`. Note that accidental use of `==` or `!=` will likely compile (since `Boolean` can be implicitly converted to `Rep[Boolean]`) but produce wrong results!

Conditional expression is `IF (cond) THEN branch1 ELSE branch2`, where `cond: Rep[Boolean`. `THEN` is optional, and `ELSEIF` can be used in place of `ELSE`. Because `IF`, `THEN` and `ELSE` are methods, they are parsed differently from normal Scala conditionals `if`, `then` and `else`. Namely, `THEN` and `ELSE` shouldn't start new lines, e.g.
~~~scala
IF (true)
  THEN true
  ELSE false
~~~
is parsed by `scalac` as 3 separate expressions and doesn't typecheck. Instead write
~~~scala
IF (true) THEN true ELSE false
~~~
or
~~~scala
IF (true)
  THEN {
    true
  } ELSE {
    false
  }
~~~

For tuples the usual Scala methods `_1`, `_2`, etc. are available. Tuples can be constructed and pattern-matched using `Pair` and `Tuple` objects.
~~~scala
val a0 = 1
val b0 = 2
val c0 = false
val tuple: Rep[(Int, (Int, Boolean))] = Tuple(a0, b0, c0)

val Tuple(a1, b1, c1) = tuple
val c2 = tuple._3
~~~
Currently tuples up to size 8 are supported.

Scalan function values must be pure (support for limited side effects is planned). They can be obtained from pure Scala functions which take and return `Rep` by an implicit conversion `fun`. If a function shouldn't be inlined, `funGlob` method can be used instead.
~~~scala
val f: Rep[Int => Int] = { x: Rep[Int] => x + 1 } // or val f = fun { x: Rep[Int] => x + 1 } or val f = fun((_: Rep[Int]) + 1)
~~~

Loops can be written as `from(startingState).until(isMatch)(step)`, where `isMatch` and `step` are pure Scala functions which take the same number and types of arguments as passed to `from` and return `Rep[Boolean]` and a tuple as above respectively.
~~~scala
val collatz = from(start).until(_ === 1) { n => IF (n % 2 === 0) THEN (n / 2) ELSE (n * 3 + 1) }
~~~

Methods can be defined using `def` keyword, as usual. Normally all arguments and return values will have `Rep` types, but this isn't required.

### User types

User types (abstract like `Vector[T]` and concrete like `DenseVector[T]`) are introduced as part of a DSL (`VectorsDsl`). For these types `T` there is an implicit conversion from `Rep[T]` to `T`, so all methods/fields of `T` are available on `Rep[T]`. If you need to add your own types see "Extending Scalan" below. It's possible to create classes with `Rep` fields, but you won't be able to stage these classes directly (i.e. obtain a `Rep[MyClass]`).

### Program structure and example

Your program needs to extends `Scalan` trait (along with any traits describing the DSLs you use) or `ScalanCommunity` if you want to use `community-edition` instead of `core`. Here is a very simple example program:
~~~scala
// ScalanCommunityDsl includes ScalanCommunity and all DSLs defined in that project
trait HelloScalan extends ScalanCommunityDsl {
  lazy val run = fun { p: Rep[(Array[Array[Double]], Array[Double])] =>
    val Pair(m, v) = p
    val matrix: Matr[Double] = RowMajorMatrix(PArray(m.map { r: Arr[Double] => DenseVector(PArray(r))}))
    val vector: Vec[Double] = DenseVector(PArray(v))
    (matrix * vector).coords.arr
  }
  // example input
  val matrix = Array(Array(1.0, 2.0), Array(3.0, 5.0))
  val vector = Array(2.0, 3.0)
  val input = (matrix, vector)
}
~~~
It can be seen to be very close to a usual Scala program, except for use of `Rep` type constructor and `fun` method. Note that `run` takes core types as argument and returns core types, not matrices and vectors themselves.

This example is available [in the repository](lms-backend/src/test/scala/HelloScalan.scala). Please raise an issue if you find it isn't up-to-date!

Now, there are two ways in which Scalan can work with this program:

#### Sequential mode

Run it without optimizations in order to ensure it works as desired and debug if necessary. This is done by mixing in `ScalanCommunityDslSeq` (and `Seq` versions of any additional DSLs used by your program):
~~~scala
// to run: lms-backend/test:runMain HelloScalanSeq
object HelloScalanSeq extends HelloScalan with ScalanCommunityDslSeq {
  def result = run(input)

  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println(result.mkString(","))
  }
}
~~~
In this mode, Scalan's behavior is very simple: `Rep[A]` is the same type as `A`, and `fun` returns its argument, so you can mentally erase all `Rep` and `fun`. However, the structure of Scalan programs inhibits some of Scala's own optimization opportunities, so it should be expected to run somewhat slower than an equivalent Scala program.

#### Staged mode

Compile it to produce optimized code by mixing in `ScalanCommunityDslExp` (and `Exp` versions of any additional DSLs) and a compiler trait.
~~~scala
// to run: lms-backend/test:runMain HelloScalanExp
object HelloScalanExp extends HelloScalan with ScalanCommunityDslExp with LmsCompilerScala with CommunityBridge {
  // allows use of standard Scala library, commented out to make tests faster
  // override val defaultCompilerConfig = CompilerConfig(Some("2.10.4"), Seq.empty)

  val lms = new CommunityLmsBackend

  def result = {
    // output directory
    val dir = new File("it-out")
    val compiled = buildExecutable(
      dir,
      // generated class name
      "HelloScalan1",
      // function to compile
      run,
      // write .dot files containing graph IR with default settings
      GraphVizConfig.default)
    // not necessary if you just want to generate
    // and compile the program
    execute(compiled, input)
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(result.mkString(","))
  }
}
~~~
Running this program will generate `HelloScalan.scala` and `HelloScalan.jar` in the given directory. `HelloScalan` class will have a `apply((Array[Array[Double]], Array[Double])): Array[Double]` method which corresponds to the `run` function. You can add either the source code or the jar to your own programs and call the `apply` method from them.

Note that generated code depends only on the Scala standard library, not on Scalan. If it's acceptable for your program to depend on Scalan, it can also call `Backend.execute` method which loads the generated class and invokes the `apply` method.

In this mode `Rep[A]` represents a value of type `A` in the generated code. Any values of non-`Rep` Scala types which appear in the Scalan program aren't represented directly.

Scalan aggressively applies optimizations such as dead code elimination, common sub-expression elimination, and function inlining independently of backend. The backend can, of course, include its own optimizations as well (a major one in the LMS backend is loop fusion).

## Understanding Scalan code

Scalan uses a variant of [cake pattern](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2011/12/19/cake-pattern-in-depth) for code organization. Namely, it is composed of a set of traits such as `Base`, `Elems`, etc. which define a component API (and helper methods using this API). Each component has two implementations `ComponentNameSeq` and `ComponentNameExp` which are used in sequential and staged mode respectively. There is a trait combining all components called `Scalan`, and corresponding `ScalanSeq` and `ScalanExp` traits. These traits are used as self-types for the components and their implementations, which allows each component to depend on all others. There are also `ScalanCtxSeq` and `ScalanCtxExp` which extend `ScalanSeq` and `ScalanExp` with implementations.

`community-edition` subproject adds more components. Their combination with `Scalan` is called `ScalanCommunity` (also with `Seq` and `Exp` versions). It also defines some DSLs which work the same as components, and `ScalanCommunityDsl` combines `ScalanCommunity` and all DSLs.

Important types to understand are: 

* `Element[A]` is a reified type representation. For all legal Scalan types `Rep[A]` an `Element[A]` instance exists and should be available implicitly.
* `Exp[A]` is `Rep[A]` in staged mode. As said above, it represents a staged value (i.e. a value in generated code) of type `A` or, more strictly speaking, an identifier of such a value.
* `Def[A]` is a definition of an `Exp[A]`.

## Extending Scalan

New methods can be added to existing types using implicit conversions:
~~~scala
implicit class Norm(arr: Rep[Array[Double]]) {
  def norm: Rep[Double] = Math.sqrt((arr *^ arr).sum)
}

val x: Rep[Array[Double]] = ...
x.norm
~~~
Normal Scala rules apply.

It's also possible to add new user types to Scalan. As a simple example, we consider points on a plane. We have a trait describing the interface, and a class describing an implementation (though in this case there is only one implementation, the split is still required). They are contained in the trait `Points` which serves as a DSL component.
~~~scala
trait Points { self: PointsDsl =>
  trait Point {
    def x: Rep[Double]
    def y: Rep[Double]
    def distance(other: Rep[Point]): Rep[Double] = Math.sqrt((x - other.x)*(x - other.x) + (y - other.y)*(y - other.y))
  }
  trait PointCompanion

  abstract class PointImpl(val x: Rep[Double], val y: Rep[Double]) extends Point
  trait PointImplCompanion
}

trait PointsDsl extends impl.PointsAbs
trait PointsDslSeq extends impl.PointsSeq
trait PointsDslExp extends impl.PointsExp
~~~
This obviously doesn't compile yet, because of references to non-existent classes in the `impl` package. They are boilerplate code which must be generated using the `meta` subproject (see [its documentation](meta/README.md)). It will have to be regenerated if `Point` or `PointImpl` are renamed or deleted, or if new implementations of `Point` are added.

Note that methods in `Point` must have `Rep` in argument types and return value type. If `Point` had a type parameter, it would also have methods asserting existence of `Element` instances. It may seem some of these empty traits are unnecessary, but they serve as extension points. E.g. any methods added to `PointCompanion` will be available on `Point` companion objects.

See `scalan.linalgebra.Vectors` for a larger example.

Adding new primitive operations, core types, or backends to Scalan is possible, but the API is currently not stable.
